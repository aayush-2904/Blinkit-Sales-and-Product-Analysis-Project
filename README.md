# Blinkit-Sales-and-Product-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard for analyzing Blinkit's sales and product performance. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, average rating, and the number of items. Various visualizations like donut charts, slicers, area charts, clustered bar charts, and funnel charts are used to present the data. Dynamic measures and DAX queries enhance the interactivity and depth of the analysis. Additionally, the project includes an analysis of fat content (low and regular) based on outlet size, location, year of establishment, and other KPIs.

# Usage
## Power BI Dashboard Components
# 1. KPIs:

* Total Sales: Displays the sum of all sales transactions.
* Average Sales: Shows the average sales per transaction.
* Average Rating: Indicates the average rating of products.
* Number of Items: Counts the total number of items sold.

# 2.Visualizations:

* Donut Chart: Used for visualizing the proportion of sales by different categories.
* Slicers: Enable filtering data based on various dimensions such as date, product category, outlet size, etc.
* Area Chart: Shows trends over time, such as sales trends.
* Clustered Bar Chart: Compares sales across different categories or outlets.
* Funnel Chart: Visualizes stages in a process, such as sales funnel stages.

# 3. Dynamic Measures and DAX Queries:

The dashboard includes custom measures created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance interactivity and provide deeper insights.
Examples of DAX measures include year-over-year growth, sales per outlet size, and average sales by location.

# 4. Fat Content Analysis
The dashboard includes a dedicated section for analyzing the impact of fat content (low and regular) based on:

* Outlet Size: Examines how fat content affects sales in small, medium, and large outlets.
* Location: Analyzes sales performance by geographic location.
* Year of Establishment: Observes trends in sales based on the year the outlet was established.
* KPIs: Evaluates how fat content correlates with total sales, average sales, average rating, and the number of items sold.
